# 1.4 Swamp Rabbit Cycling

This project started the work in understanding Bootstrap styling. This was the first project of week 2.



### Tech Used

During the development of this project I used the following technology:


* [HTML5] - latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages
* [CSS3] - latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
